summary: 'Media theorist Friedrich Kittler's zany yet uncanny theory of human obsolescence'

In our current moment, machines talk to machines. 

I apply for jobs by asking ChatGPT 9o-mini to form a resume and a cover letter, which then goes directly to HR software that parses through the machine-generated text to deliver an automated rejection. The hiring manager uses that same language model to draft a rejection email to me.

I am completely incidental to the massive volumes of communication that occur today on my behalf. I no longer ask *whether* artificial intelligence will eclipse us. I do not even ask how long it will take. It's already here for me.

To understand the chilling certainty of our impending obsolescence, we need to look through the lens of thinkers who grasped the fundamental forces shaping our world. Among them, German media theorist Friedrich Kittler stands as an unlikely, yet prescient thinker of our technological destiny. To Kittler, the true subject of history is — and *always has been* — technology, not humanity.

His seminal *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter* asserts that "media determine our situation" and offers a framework for understanding how the current wave of artificial intelligence will redefine—and ultimately negate—humanity's role in the world. 

In his timeline, prior to the 20th century, we lived in the literary epoch: all communication needed to occur through the bottleneck of the signifier. To communicate with the masses, one needed to fit one's thoughts into printable words or sheet music.

This changed with the development of three technologies: the gramophone, film, and typewriter, a trio Kittler associates with Jacques Lacan's Real, Imaginary, and Symbolic, respectively. The gramophone and film allowed for static to be captured, expanding the data flows that could be captured — no longer constrained by the literary monopoly. On the other hand, the typewriter might be — the ultimate push towards discretization. When one writes by hand, you’re expressing ideas. The typewriter was radical to Kittler, though, because every time you write a word you do it the same way. Kittler argued that discretization would dominate our digital future. In a way, everything is a typewriter now.

The project of Lacanian psychoanalysis, one could say, is to explain the mass discontent and disjointedness we experience in modernity. If this is the task, Kittler provides a satisfying answer: we feel this way because we live in a world of mechanical symbols that is wholly indifferent to us. The true subject of history is technology. What we perceive as transitioning into human obsolescence is actually a cycle. We are moving forward in history, but we must recognize time for the spiral phenomenon it is.

Kittler saw "so-called Man" (a phrase he repeats mockingly) as increasingly subsumed by the "march of technological auto-sophistication." Whatever we are is a byproduct of our media, because media determine our situation. It is only now that we become more aware of this truth.
