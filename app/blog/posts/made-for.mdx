summary: 'A Christian essay on planned obsolescence.'
---

Most people in product design are familiar with the concept of planned obsolescence, where products are given a limited useful life, often artificially. 

Take the iPhone, for example. Apple was sued recently for deliberately gutting battery life over time to incentivize customers to purchase new models. Done correctly, and this practice incentivizes repeated purchases, despite the obvious moral transgression here: If you have the capacity to create things that are good, why create things that are worse?

Some have theorized that humankind at large can be described as "planned obsolescence." We were created to die. Note that this is different from individual death. We obviously die, but we reproduce. What I am talking about is what affects us as a species, as a single organism — when Humanity 1.0 gets replaced with Humanity 2.0, I will be forced to confront what I did with my old iPhones. Will we be thrown away? Will we be dissected for parts to sell? 

My faith is strong, so I have extreme difficulty reckoning with the idea that we were placed on this planet to be replaced. I turn to Genesis 1:27 — So God created mankind in his own image. 

Before the rise of the T.O., I used to fantasize about the Second Coming. No matter what personal struggles I would encounter, I would rest assured that someone of my faith would be spared by the Rapture. I dreamed of a place like the New Jerusalem, where tears would never fall.

I see the T.O. as attempting to create their own millennium of prosperity, but for themselves. I, as someone without technological prowess or extreme wealth, would become obsolete. I can only hope if the Rapture comes, they will be judged appropriately, and order will be restored. The sin of the T.O. will be washed clean.

Nevertheless, as I live now, every time I look at a robot powered by artificial general intelligence, I see my own death.
