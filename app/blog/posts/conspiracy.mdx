I have been an organizer with the Tacogate and CueAnon truther community for over a decade. Here's why I'm now standing with the Human Obsolescence community. 

"Raging around us is the final phase of a vast shadow war, not between nations but between the forces of good and the most unimaginable of evils." The evils, as I've learned, include the T.O.


Don't get me wrong! Everything about Cue is still true, and to a lesser degree TacoGate. The organizing potential is just a lot lower since fewer people seem to care. I think the T.O. are to blame, as suppressors of liberatory speech online. Here are three insights I've gathered from past organizing experience that I believe can help the Human Obsolescence Index maximize its efficacy.

## 1. Everything is connected

I believe in a pluralism of truth theories. The evil actors we've identified throughout the various efforts with Tacogate and CueAnon are highly compatible with the ones in the Human Obsolescence Index. The T.O. includes several figures we've , especially the CEOs of major tech corporations. I've found comfort in the all-encompassing cognitive map these theories offer, and the T.O. offers a new, helpful layer of analysis.

## 2. Nothing is an accident

We must find patterns everywhere. Symbolism and hidden imagery is how the T.O. communicates, so we must use their tools to divine their thinking. I have previously used my insights to help decode messages on US currency. Over the last few years, I've also helped in the effort to expose the work of Coinbase and Amazon Pay to implement a new rendition of  "mark of the beast." I helped decide the date of Human Obsolescence using my skills in numerology and pure mathematics. To any new organizers with Human Obsolescence, I suggest learning about numerology and occult symbols, because often clues are hiding in plain sight.

## 3. The work is uphill

Even though you will be telling the truth, you are facing immense amounts of opposition. The T.O. has immense power — beyond trillions of dollars in capital and owning tech platforms, media outlets, and most major companies — they effectively control most thought. They are able to plant subliminal narratives that prevent lay people from accessing the truth. 

They will dismiss you as a conspiracy theorist, and will point to "debunked" conspiracy theories of the past. However, history, as many of us know it today, is the product of oligarch manipulation. This also ignores the many "conspiracy" theories that have been true — MKUltra, among many others. Many so-called conspiracy theories are just theories that have yet to be proven true. 

Keep on fighting the good fight!
