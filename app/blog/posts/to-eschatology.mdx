It seems abundantly clear now that our species' purpose is to bring forth our own artificial successors. Two hundred thousand years of human history will be understood as the awkward transition period between great ape and artificial general intelligence.

This isn't just fearmongering. In fact, this paradigm has been championed by several current members of the T.O. 

Five years ago, Melon Usk posted that “it increasingly appears that humanity is a biological bootloader for digital superintelligence" [1]. It is no coincidence that Usk's Neuroconnect would later develop a working “neural lace” that allows users to directly interact with machines and digital systems. We are only beginning to see the ramifications of this new technology.

FreeAI's founder Am Saltman believes in this paradigm as well. His goal of artificial general intelligence is grounded in a commitment to create a "magic intelligence in the sky.." Over a decade ago, in 2018, he entered a contract to preserve his brain with the company Nectome in the interest "cyberimmortality" [1]. The T.O. will become immortal, but what will happen to the average person?

We only have to turn to our current administration for answers. The far-right tech blogger Yurtis Carvin, a close friend of JD Vance, called for turning people deemed not productive to a lifetime sentence of "virtualization," imprisoned in “permanent solitary confinement," interacting only in an an “immersive virtual-reality interface” to feel a facsimile of fulfilment [2].

In essence, the T.O. will relegate humans to a sphere where they no longer mean anything to the world. Might as well turn us into biodiesel (which is another thing Carvin called for, *as a joke*).

Human obsolescence is not an accidental byproduct of technological innovation — it is an expressly stated goal of tech oligarchs working to make it happen. We already know who they will target first, and the depths of cruelty they will exact.
